# Master's Degree Thesis

This is my Master's Degree thesis repository. It's about Signal Modulation Classification using Deep Learning.

I'm still writing the thesis document, it will be available here soon (before march 2022).

# Prerequisites

Follow those steps to get all running.

## Dataset

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.deepsig.ai/datasets). Extract the dataset in a directory named _data/_. Dataset file should has to be named _RML2016.10a_dict.pkl_.

## Python and pip

You need to have Python (at least 3.9.x) and pip (included with Python) installed on your system.

## CUDA

Check if your GPU is CUDA enabled [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

I had a problem with CUDA in the beginning, problem/solution couple available [here on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68546140/cant-train-with-gpu-in-tensorflow).

### CUDA Toolkit

You need to install CUDA Toolkit in your System: [download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).

### cuDNN Library

You need to install cuDNN Library in your System: [download](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download) and follow NVDIA [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html)
